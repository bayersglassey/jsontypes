Example JSON files from json.org/example.html.

To see the schemas of the files, run the following script:

    $ python show_examples.py

Or just [click here to see the current output of that script](/examples/output.txt).

They're admittedly not very exciting, because the json.org examples are very regular,
so you don't end up with a lot of unions in the resulting schemas...

Maybe more interesting is to run the generate_github_event_examples.py script, which
generates [output like this](/examples/github_event_output.txt). Cooool.
